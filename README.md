# [Cassandra Cunningham Portfolio](https://scriptsculptorjs.github.io/cassandra-cunningham-portfolio/)
A personal portfolio website built from scratch. It shares information about me and showcases some of the projects I've worked on. This was a fun and rewarding project that highlights both my technical skills and creative approach.

It is responsive to all screen sizes. When the screen is on the smaller size, the 2 nav bars merge into one dropdown menu. Any links to outside sources will open in a new window.
